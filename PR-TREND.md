Testing on seltzer batch data, average 15 minutes, 96 readings per day

- Linear require at least 25 data points to have a calculation that does not vary too much.
- Exponential require at least 30 data points to have a calculation that does not vary too much.
- Polynomial (order 1) require at least 30 data points to have a calculation that does not vary too much.
- Polynomial (order 2) require at least 50 data points to have a calculation that does not vary too much.
- Polynomial (order 3) require at least 80 data points to have a calculation that does not vary too much.
